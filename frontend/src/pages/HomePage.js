        Hi, my name is Richard Le and this is my first website. I built this
        website from the MERN stack which includes MongoDB, Express, React, and
        Node.js. This website is my portfolio project for my Web Development
        Course at Oregon State University and showcases the connectivity between
        the pieces of the stack. I used React to program all the frontend.
        Which includes learning languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. For
        the backend, we use MongoDB to host our data. Then we use Express as the
        middleware to connect the backend to the frontend. Meanwhile, we use
        Node.js to install our dependencies and manage our packages to make
        replicating our applications a lot easier and faster.
