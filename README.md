# cs290-portfolio-website
Personal portfolio website I developed while taking my Web Development course (CS 290) at Oregon State University

Only the frontend portion is functional so unfortunately the Log page does not work :(. To launch the website run 
"npm start" from the terminal when in the frontend directory.
